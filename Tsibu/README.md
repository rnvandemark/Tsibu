# TSIBU

TSIBU (pronounced SEE-boo) is an infinitely recursive acronym for "TSIBU Surely Is Bottom-Up" (like WINE, KATE, or YAML are). This is an AI based on Rodney Brooks' model of bottom-up artificial intelligence, and some of its characteristics include being embodied in its environment, low-cost data processing and responses to external stimuli, and parallelized finite state machine operation.

I started this project in April of 2019 as part of an independent study I designed, which focused on the philosophy of a couple of AI development paradigms, and drew conclusions on the (dis)advantages of each in philosophical, technical, historical, physiological, and neurological aspects.

Development continued for a class I had this last summer semester as well, where my goals were to integrate depth sensing, as well as develop and integrate a learning model I designed. I was able to start and have a finished first version of the depth sensing integration, but have yet to get into the learning model development. I was able to research different types of models and isolate where it could be used in my project, so when I can start development for it, I have a starting place.
