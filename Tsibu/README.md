TSIBU (pronounced SEE-boo) is an acronym for "TSIBU Surely Is Bottom-Up", and is an AI based on Rodney Brooks' model
of bottom-up AI. Some of these characteristics include being embodied in its environment, low-cost data processing
and responses to external stimuli, and highly parallelized finite state machine operation.

I started this project in April of 2019 as part of an independent study I designed, which focused on the philosophy
of a couple of AI development paradigms, and drew conclusions on the (dis)advantages of each in philosophical,
technical, historical, physiological, and neurological aspects.

This is actively being developed on for a class I have this semester as well, where my goals are to integrate depth
sensing, as well as develop and integrate a learning model I design.
